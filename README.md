# corrodedbar

A simple statusbar for X11 window managers which display the root window name somewhere on screen (such as dwm).

Oh, and it's written in Rust. ðŸ¦€

## Usage

To install, run:

```bash
cargo build --release
cp target/release/corrodedbar ~/.local/bin # or somewhere else in your $PATH
```

Then, just add `corrodedbar` into your window manager's autostart script. Upon first launch, it will generate an example config file which you can edit to further suit your needs.
